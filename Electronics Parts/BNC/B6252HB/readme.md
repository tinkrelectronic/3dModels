The Final Source File is the file used for the exported step/wrl in FreeCAD V 21.2 Cause Bugs.....

The other is the original FreeCAD V 1.0 File

Note:

There is a bug in FreeCAD which doesn't allow lining up of the pocket and hole/circular extrusion. I've tried it with pockets and pads, both screw up the results. So those results in the final back circular portions being slightly smaller.
